						<p><b>Boomer</b> is the first pet we have as a family and now we consider him one more member. He was born on December 29, 2020, he was 
						the youngest of his litter and the only one gray, his brothers are brown, his mother is light brown and his father is black.</p>	
						<p>Everyone in the family loves him very much. We saw him grow up from a young age; we heard his first bark, and his peculiar way 
						of walking makes him unique.</p>
						<p>now, we have learned a pet is not only an animal, it is like a son or brother instead is a member of the family,
						it has its needs, you have to give it a walk, you have to feed it and you have to give it love. Remember with great
						joy when it was his first shot and he kept his leg straight like a human, which was fun. Soon I will tell more 
						stories now in Canada, however, he enjoys his walks a lot.</p>
						<p>Here, I put some references of <a href="https://theconversation.com/when-pets-are-family-the-benefits-extend-into-society-109179#:~:text=Children%20with%20pets%20may%20have,who%20consider%20pets%20as%20property.
