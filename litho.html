						<p>As background I will mention that there was no programming department, the production files to print the 
						documents were generated with excel and text. Therefore, the time was extensive and required too many people. 
						The project was the creation of the programming area since the company bought new machinery to securely print 
						documents such as lottery tickets, checks, vouchers, and ballots.</p>	
						<p>As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, the department's creation was developed and structured according 
						to the company's needs. The languages used for any development were C#, Java and Inspire Desing. 
						The developments were specific to each client and had modules such as the generation of print files in 
						<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/es/i/7.3?topic=concepts-overview-afp-printing" target="_new1">AFP</a> format, 
						lists, box and band labels, and distribution reports.</p>
						<p>Finally, I will mention that in each project a pre-start meeting was held for development, where the needs of 
						the departments involved such as design, printing, finishing, packaging, and distribution were evaluated. Each 
						department made its requirement of reports or labels according to its needs and later began with said development. 
						In addition, the company had post-processes, such as folding and cutting, that had to be considered in the programming 
						to carry out more effective packaging in the shortest possible time.</p>
